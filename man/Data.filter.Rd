\title{A Data Filter}
\description{
	This function creates a new dataset from an existing one that collapses less-abundant taxa into one category as 
	specified by the user and excludes samples with a total number of reads fewer than the user-specified value.
}

\usage{Data.filter(data, order.type, reads.crit, K)}

\arguments{
  \item{data}{A matrix of taxonomic counts(columns) for each sample(rows).}
  \item{order.type}{
		If \code{"sample"}: Rank taxa based on its taxonomic frequency. \cr
		If \code{"data"}: Rank taxa based on cumulative taxonomic counts across all samples.}
  \item{reads.crit}{Samples with a total number of reads less than read.crit's value will be deleted.}
  \item{K}{The K most abundant taxa.}
}

\value{
	A data frame with K+1 ranked columns and the number of rows equal to number of samples with a total number of reads greater than the critical value. 
	The (K+1)th taxon contains the sum of the remaining less abundant taxa equal to (number of columns-K).
