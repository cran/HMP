CHANGES IN HMP VERSION 1.4.3

BUG FIXES

* Fixed a bug in the DM.MoM function



CHANGES IN HMP VERSION 1.4

CHANGES

* Changed several functions to improve performance

* MC.Xdc.statistic and MC.Xoc.statistics now calculates n.groups themselves

* Xmcupo.sevsample now calculates K itself

* Added a function to format and combine multiple data sets with different taxa

* Added a Kullback Leiber function



CHANGES IN HMP VERSION 1.3.1

CHANGES

* Changed the MC example files to use "DM.MoM" instead of "dirmult" for speed


BUG FIXES

* Fixed a bug in MC.Xmcupo.statistics that produced a incorrect result under type="ha"



CHANGES IN HMP VERSION 1.3

CHANGES

* Updated several of the MC functions to perform power calculations on unbalanced designs, 
  however it should be noted that this caused the Nrs parameter to change from a vector to a 
  list for several functions.
  
* Removed the initscalar parameter from the sevsample functions and replaced it with the value
  of gamma from the DM.MoM function.

* Change the names of some functions so they all follow the same formatting.  This change mainly 
  affected internal functions.
  
* Changed the wording of the return value in the MC functions from "effect size" to "size of the 
  test statistics" to correctly describe what is being returned.
  
* Changed the Barchart.data function to take a full title rather than just a taxa level.

* Changed Xdc.sevsample to select between 'mle' and 'mom' estimators.

* Added several warnings/notes clarifying that the value of MC should be >1000 in the MC.functions

* Added several warnings/notes clarifying the use of different number of reads in a sample

* Added two new functions: Xmcupo.effectsize and pioest

BUG FIXES

* Fixed a bug in MC.Xdc.statistics where k was not set to the right value under "ha".
